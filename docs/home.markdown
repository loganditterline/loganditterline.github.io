# Hello!

Welcome to my portfolio! On this site you'll find a history of my previous experiences as well as past projects I have developed personally. I'm currently a senior at the University of Texas at Austin, slated to graduated in December 2023. I am primarily interested in backend development but also have experience in frontend development.
