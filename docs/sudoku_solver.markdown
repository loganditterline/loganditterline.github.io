# Welcome to Sudoku Visualizer and Solver | <a href="https://github.com/loganditterline/sudoku_visualizer" target="_blank"><img src="../assets/images/github-mark-white.png" alt="GitHub Logo" width="25" height="25"></a>

This project was meant to help me understand backtracking and used a sudoku context to do so. I really enjoy playing sudoku myself and having a program to solve puzzles was of interest to me. Developed in Python, this program uses backtracking to solve a sudoku puzzle whilst also visualizing the backtracking of the program.

## Demo
