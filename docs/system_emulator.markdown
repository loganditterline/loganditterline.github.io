# Welcome to System Emulator

This project was focused on the implementation of a system's architecture. Written in C, this was meant to be a pedagogic exercise to implement a cache system, understand pipelining and system processes, and create simple commands associated with x86 architecture. During this exercise, I implemented various forwarding of the instruction cycle, a simple cache system with a 4-way set associative cache, and a simple pipelined processor.
